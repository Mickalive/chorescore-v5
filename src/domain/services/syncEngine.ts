/**
 * ChoreScore V3 — Sync Engine
 *
 * Delta-only sync with per-group revision cursors.
 *
 * Design principles (from V3_BACKEND_FRUGAL.md §2-3):
 *   - Each client stores a cursor per household per collection.
 *   - Sync fetches only records with revision > local cursor.
 *   - A single lightweight change signal replaces per-collection listeners.
 *   - Push sends local dirty records since last push revision.
 *   - No full-collection downloads, no N+1 reads.
 *
 * This is a pure domain service.  It operates on SyncStateRepository
 * and never imports Firebase, Firestore, or any provider-specific code.
